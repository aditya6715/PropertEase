Introduction:
In the dynamic world of real estate, efficient management of
transactions and client relationships is paramount to success.
To address the needs of a real-estate office aiming to
streamline its operations, this project embarks on designing a
robust database system. The system is tailored to manage
agents, buyers, sellers, properties on the market, and recently
sold properties, catering primarily to residential real estate
transactions. 
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to design a database system for a
real-estate office to manage agents, buyers, sellers, properties
on the market, and recently sold properties. The database
system will facilitate tracking and management of real-estate
transactions.
Key Features and Considerations:
• Agent Management: Keeps track of agents including their contact
information and performance metrics.
• Buyer and Seller Management: Maintains information about buyers
and sellers, including their contact details and preferences.
• Property Management: Manages properties on the market, including
details such as address, price, size, and features.
• Transaction History: Tracks recently sold properties, including
transaction details and parties involved.
• User-Friendly Interface: Considering the management's limited
computer literacy, the systemhave a simple and intuitive interface.
Design and Implementation Approach:
• Requirement Analysis: We first analyzed the needs of the real-estate
office by studying the provided information and real-estate websites.
• Entity-Relationship (E-R) Modeling: We created an E-R diagram
representing the conceptual design of the database. Include entity sets
for agents, buyers, sellers, properties, and relationship sets representing
interactions between them.
• Database Schema Design: We converted the E-R model into a relational
schema. Define tables for each entity set, ensuring primary keys and
appropriate attributes are included.
• Refinement: We normalized all the relations to achieve the goal of
minimum redundancy. All the tables are in Boyce-Codd Normal Form
(BCNF).
• Populate Sample Data: We Populated the database with sample data to
demonstrate its functionality. Ensure data privacy by using fictional
information.
How to Run:
• SQL file: The SQL files can be run on MySQL workbench.
• Web Interface: To run the web interface:
▪ Install node modules running ‘npm i’ in both client and
server folder.
▪ To run the server use ‘node index.js’
▪ To run the Client use ‘npm star
